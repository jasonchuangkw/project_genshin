#### Executive Summary

TBA

#### Problem Statement

Determine what are the different archetypes based on available game data that could help the Genshin Impact plauyers know more about themselves and the community. Where possible, the findings could provide some suggestions or tips to gthe players based on the archetype they belong to.

#### Background

Gaming companies potentially have a lot of user data that can help them to understand their players better. One method is to adopt the marketing segmentation approach by having customised strategies for different archetypes. For games that are based on free-to-play (F2P) which have microtransactions for players to spend real money on game assets, it is quite typical to segment players based on their profitability. Games which have been around for a longer time might look at new gamers, lapsed gamers and existing active gamers. This project takes the perspective of gamers to identify different archetypes based publicly avaiable data, so that it will be useful to players to understand how involved they are in the game as compared to others.
